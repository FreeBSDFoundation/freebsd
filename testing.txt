The note explains how to perform useful testing of the ino64 branch,
beyond usual checks.

Main risk of the ino64 change is the ABI breakage.  Due to expansion of
the basic types dev_t, ino_t and struct dirent, the impact is not limited
to some part of the system, but affects:
- kernel/userspace interface (syscalls ABI, mostly stat(2), kinfo,
  but not only)
- libc interface (mostly related to the readdir(3), FTS(3))
- collateral damage in other libraries that happens to use changed types
  in the interfaces.  See, for instance, libprocstat, for which compat
  was provided using symbol versioning, and libutil, which shlib version
  was bumped.
