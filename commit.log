Commit the 64-bit inode project.

Extend the ino_t, dev_t, nlink_t types to 64bit ints.  Modify struct
dirent layout to include d_off, and change required alignment.
Increase struct statfs f_mntfromname[] and f_mntonname[] array length
MNAMELEN to 1024.

ABI breakage is mitigated by providing compatibility using versioned
symbols, ingenious use of the existing padding in structures, and by
employing other tricks.  Unfortunately, not everything can be fixed,
especially outside the base system.  For instance, third-party APIs
which pass struct stat around are broken in backward and forward-
incompatible way.

Kinfo sysctl MIBs ABI is changed in backward-compatible way, but there
is no general mechanism to handle other sysctl MIBS which return
structures where the layout has changed. It was considered that the
breakage is either in the management interfaces, where we usually
allow ABI slip, or is not important.

Struct xvnode changed layout, no compat shims are provided.

For struct xtty, dev_t tty device member was reduced to uint32_t.  It
was decided that keeping ABI compat in this case is more useful than
reporting 64bit dev_t, for the sake of pstat.

Update note: strictly follow the instructions in UPDATING.  Build and
install new kernel with COMPAT_FREEBSD11 option enabled, then reboot,
and only then install new world.

The 64-bit inode project, also known as ino64, started life many years
ago as a project by Gleb Kurtsou (gleb).  mckusick then picked up and
updated the patch, and acted as a flag-waver.  Feedback, suggestions
and discussions were carried by emaste, jhb, jilles, rmacklem.  kris
performed an initial ports investigation followed by an exp-run by
antoine.  Essential and all-embracing testing was done by pho.
